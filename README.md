# Coding Challenge

A work-in-progress, simple React app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open (http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Design decisions made

I did not attended any web-design classes, so how this app looks could be better.
I didn't wanted to put too many animations, different colors etc. to achive a minimalistic website.
App is simple buy its nature, so I thought that design should be also minimalistic to be consistent.
